    "The **training error** can be easily calculated by applying the statistical learning method to the observations used in its training. But because of overfitting, the training error rate can dramatically underestimate the error that would be obtained on new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **test error** is the average error that results from a learning method to predict the response on a new samples that is, on samples that were not used in training the method. Given a data set, the use of a particular learning method is warranted if it results in a low test error. The test error can be easily calculated if a designated test set is available. Unfortunately, this is usually not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the original dataset is generally splited in a training and a test (or validation) data sets. Large training set (80%) small test set (20%) might provide a poor estimation of the predictive performances. On the contrary, large test set and small training set might produce a poorly estimated learner. This is why, on situation where we cannot afford such split, it recommended to use cross-Validation scheme to estimate the predictive power of a learning algorithm.\n",

    "## Cross-Validation (CV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation scheme randomly divid the set of observations into $K$ groups, or **folds**, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method $f()$ is fitted on the remaining union of $K - 1$ folds: ($f(X_{-K}, y_{-K})$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean error measure (generally a loss function) is evaluated of the on the observations in the held-out fold. For each sample $i$ we consider the model estimated on the data set that did not contain it, noted $-K(i)$. This procedure is repeated $K$ times; each time, a different group of observations is treated as a test set.\n",
    "Then we compare the predicted value ($f(X_{-K(i)}) = \\hat{y_i})$ with true value $y_i$ using a Error function $L()$. Then the cross validation estimate of prediction error is\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This validation scheme is known as the **K-Fold CV**. Typical choices of $K$ are 5 or 10, [Kohavi 1995]. The extreme case where $K = N$ is known as **leave-one-out cross-validation, LOO CV**."

Indeed remember that most of learning algorithm have a hyper parameters (typically the regularization parameter) that has to be set.\n",

    "\n",
    "- the **validation set** (val) is used to estimate prediction error for model selection or to determine the hyper parameters over a grid of possible values.\n",
