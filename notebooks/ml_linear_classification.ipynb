    "Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, that find a linear combination of features that discriminate samples from two or more classes. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.\n",

    "This geometric method do not make probabilistic assumption, it only relies on distances. It look for the linear projection (rotation) that maximizes between / within variances. It should be considered as a pedagogical experimental method. However with few assumptions it will provide the same results than LDA.\n",
    "Suppose t\\betao classes of observations have means $\\mu_0$, $\\mu_1$ with the same covariance $\\Sigma$. Then the linear combination of features $\\beta \\cdot x$ have means $\\beta \\cdot \\mu_i$ for i=0,1 and variance $\\beta^T \\Sigma \\beta$. Fisher defined the separation between these two distributions to be the ratio of the variance between the classes to the variance within the classes:\n",
