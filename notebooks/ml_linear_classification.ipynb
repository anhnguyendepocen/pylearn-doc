    "\n",
    "Learning with discriminative (logistic regression, SVM) methods is generally based on minimizing the misclassification of training samples, which may be unsuitable for imbalanced datasets where the recognition might be biased in favor of\n",
    "the most numerous class. This problem can be addressed with a generative approach, which typically requires\n",
    "more parameters to be determined leading to reduced performances in high dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with imbalanced class may be addressed by three main ways (see Japkowicz and Stephen (2002) for a review), resampling, reweighting and one class learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **sampling strategies**, either the minority class is oversampled or majority class is undersampled or some combination of the two is deployed. Undersampling (Zhang and Mani, 2003) the majority class would lead to a poor usage of the left-out samples. Sometime one cannot afford such strategy since we are also facing a small sample size problem even for the majority class.\n",
    "Informed oversampling, which goes beyond a trivial duplication of minority class samples, requires the estimation of class conditional distributions in order to generate synthetic samples. Here generative models are required. An alternative, proposed in (Chawla et al., 2002) generate samples along the line segments joining any/all of the k minority class nearest neighbors. Such procedure blindly generalizes the minority area without regard to the majority class, which may be particularly problematic with high-dimensional and potentially skewed class distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reweighting**, also called cost-sensitive learning, works at an algorithmic level by adjusting the costs of the various classes to counter the class imbalance. Such reweighting can be implemented within SVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) or logistic regression (Friedman et al., 2010) classifiers. Most classiers of Scikit learn offer such reweighting possibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ``class_weight`` parameter can be positionned into the ``\"balanced\"`` mode which uses the values of $y$ to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as $N / (2 N_k)$."
